The top half of this asset requires some assembly to use correctly.
You can either program the sprite to use two layers (ideal), or use a graphical editor to assemble them manually.
The first 4 sprites in the first 4 rows are just bodies with no head.
You'll need to choose a head to the right of those and put it on one of the bodies.

The bodies are in the following poses:
Column 1: Standing with tail up (the natural idle pose)
Column 2: Standing with tail down (flash this one briefly for a tail flip)
Column 3: Leg up (use to show more alertness)
Column 4: Leg up, tail down (again, just a quick tail flip)

To the right of each row of bodies, is a series of heads made to work on the bodies in that row.
Column 5: Head down, ears up/down (flash the down ears for a quick flutter)
Column 6: Head up, ears up/down
Column 7: Head right, ears forward/back (flash the back ears for a quick flutter or a transition when turning the head)
Column 8: Head left, ears forward/back
Column 9: Head eating grass 1
Column 10: Head eating grass 2 (loop 1 and 2 to create a subtle chewing animation)

I chose to leave these unassembled because there are a lot of possibilities (160 in total).
You can have the deer look around suspiciously, chew some grass, then pick up a leg while looking around some more.
All with occasional tail flips or ear twitches, giving it realistic deer-like mannerisms.

The bottom half of this asset requires no assembly.

The first 4 columns contain a 4-frame walk animation (left to right).
Each frame should have the same timing, I like 200ms.

The second 4 columns contain the 4-frame run/jump animation (left to right).
I like the following timing on this animation loop: 100ms/200ms/160ms/100ms

The 3 separate sprites to the right form a death animation (going down from the top).
These should run pretty quick, maybe 150ms, then hold on the last one for a dead deer.
